How it works:
* Nearest neighbor interpolation is an algorithm used for upscaling images. 

* It takes the original smaller image and looks at the pixels, and then it makes a new bigger image by taking the pixel colours and copy them to the neighbor pixels that are empty. 

* It finds the right colour by looking at the original pictures pixel colour and then finds the spot on the new image by 


* We have visualised this process by
